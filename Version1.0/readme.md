This Repository is used STRICTLY for the updating the main submission files using additions submitted through the Version1Submission folder; i.e. submit your finished task to the Version1Sumbission folder, from there we can transfer the code changes into the Version1.0 folder. This allows for users to generate and maintain a strong series of 'commits' throughout the duration of the project, and allows for the professor to accurately and fairly grade us / see that we're all contributing heavily.
