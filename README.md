# CSC212-Project-2
Shared repository for group project in URI CSC 212 - Data Structures and Algorithms
Group members consist of: Nathaniel Brown, Rebecca Iselin, Insert Name, Insert Name. 

Project *must* consist of three major aspects. Source Code, Class Presentation, Project Report.

Source Code Breakdown:
- *Code Repository* (Github - all group members must contribute and have clear commit histories). To ensure this we will utilize a system where the main version files are not directly reuploaded by the users. Instead we will have a seperate 'submissions' repository folder where we will submit our individual work; and then patchwork those submissions into the current version files. (Will discuss in meeting 1)
- *Code Organization* Code must be clear and consist - honestly this can just be handled towards the end of the project; but generally write your own pseudo-code to ease understanding of other group members when they have to evaluate your submissions.
- *Code Compilation* I.E. INSTRUCTIONS. Direct instructions wtihin our final readme document, within repository. (Again; just handle this at the end imo)

Presentation Breakdown:
- 15 Minute Presentation. Exact time; so we will utilize timers to cut members off if they're dragging on for too long. In order to get through the presentation as a whole.
- 8 Mins for Topic intro and algorithm explanation. (Two Members)
- Review of the Source Code; compilation and demonstration of our outputs. (One Member)
- ~3 Minutes for Answering Questions (One Member) <--- What are your thoughts on this? What if no questions are asked? Group member would be stiffed.

Report Breakdown:
- Title Page; group members, project topic with concentration, date stamps.
- Table of Contents; headings, subheadings...
- Body: - Introduction to Topic (context, purpose; just surface level detail). Intro to Project (what/why we chose it, how it matches with topic???). Breakdown of the algorithm in depth. Implementation breakdown (describes the overall work, highlights important sections of code (especially over the top work), *PROOFS* (i.e. input scenarios... outputs, detailed descriptions of them all).
- Contributions (Screenshots from our spreadsheet - maintained by Nathaniel. Notes by all.)
- Conclusion: Wrap up our research and findings from programming. I.e. Go over scenarios in which this algorithm can be useful in the real world.


MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR CODE:
- Implement Sierpinski's Triangle, Hilbert's Curve, and Koch's Snowflake
- Each must print an image or pdf (lets be consistent and decide which).
- From here we need to determine an extra task; bare minimum is not the goal. 3 Recursive outputs shouldn't be too hard among 4 people over 4 weeks.

  *I'd (Nathaniel) like to work on the Snowflake; it sounds neat*
