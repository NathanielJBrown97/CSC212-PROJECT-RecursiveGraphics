Shared repository for group project in URI CSC 212 - Data Structures and Algorithms


## START HERE:
Welcome to the readme.md for the Group 14's recurssive graphics program. We cover three major algorithms, ***Koch's Snowflake, Sierpinski's Triangle, and Hilbert's Curve***. All of which are implemented within a basic user interface, and utilizing the SFML library. <br />
**_OPEN FINAL VERSION 3.0 TO CONTINUE_** within that folder you will find the finalized version of our code. This is the submission to be graded. Within you will find the PDF to the Compile instructions, and the SFML install instructions. (These are both available within our report as well). <br />
If you'd like you can browse through Versions 1.0 and Versions 2.0 to see the various stages of our program's development, and the respective algorithms .cpp development. For a more detailed overview as to what the group was working on _Please visit this spreadsheet; or view the member contributions section of our Report:_ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19O4S9ikLLG0a7wsFFYNZiAYdWw9_vF0suITosEG15Ys/edit?usp=sharing

## Report TL:DR
### Project Description:
This project is all about recurssive graphics! We use sfml, along with recursive functions to draw well known fractals such as... <br /> 
Koch's Snowflake <br />
