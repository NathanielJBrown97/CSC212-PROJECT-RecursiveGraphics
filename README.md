**CSC212-Project-2**
Shared repository for group project in URI CSC 212 - Data Structures and Algorithms
Group members consist of: Nathaniel Brown (Koch), Rebecca Iselin (Sierpinski), Alexandria Sampalis (Sierpinski), Aeyva Rebelo (Hilbert).

**START HERE:**
Welcome to the readme.md for the Group 14's recurssive graphics program. We cover three major algorithms, Koch's Snowflake, Sierpinski's Triangle, and Hilbert's Curve. All of which are implemented within a basic user interface, and utilizing the SFML library. **_OPEN FINAL VERSION 3.0 TO CONTINUE_** within that folder you will find the finalized version of our code. This is the submission to be graded. Within you will find the PDF to the Compile instructions, and the SFML install instructions. (These are both available within our report as well). 

If you'd like you can browse through Versions 1.0 and Versions 2.0 to see the various stages of our programs development, and the respective algorithms .cpp development.For a more detailed aspect as to what the group was working on when _Please visit this spreadsheet; or view the member contributions section of our Report:_ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19O4S9ikLLG0a7wsFFYNZiAYdWw9_vF0suITosEG15Ys/edit?usp=sharing
